Failed jobs may be retried in the future based on a backoff algorithm (exponential with jitter by default). With the optional `backoff/1` callback you can customize the seconds between retries based on any job attributes.

#MyElixirStatus #ObanTips

```elixir

    # Use a linear backoff based on the attempt
    def backoff(%Job{attempt: attempt}), do: attempt

    # Clamp the backoff to compensate for a high max_attempts
    def backoff(%Job{attempt: attempt}) do
      :math.pow(2, min(attempt, 15))
    end

    # Use a fixed period for a particular tag, otherwise use the default
    def backoff(%Job{attempt: attempt, tags: tags} = job) do
      if "rush_job" in tags do
        30
      else
        Worker.backoff(job)
      end
    end

```
